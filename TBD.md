# To-Be-Done

- Change the "variables"/"constants" semantics
  - Constants will also have an uncertainty
  - `None` will mean that the user does not know the uncertainty but wishes the final formula to include the derivation by that symbol.
  - 0 will mean that the user does know the uncertainty, but it truly is zero so its derivation will be excluded from the final formula.
